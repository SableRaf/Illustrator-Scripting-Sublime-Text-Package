Illustrator Scripting Sublime Text 2 Package
============================================

**This is a work in progress. Please do not use for production.**

Sublime Text 2 package for building extenscript (jsx) in Illustrator CC. Based on the [package for After Effects](https://github.com/seblavoie/After-Effects-Scripting-Sublime-Text-Package) by Seb Lavoie.
