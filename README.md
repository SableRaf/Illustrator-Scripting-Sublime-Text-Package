Illustrator Scripting Sublime Text 2 Package
============================================

**This is a work in progress. Use at your own risk.**

Sublime Text 2 package for building extenscript (jsx) in Illustrator CC. Based on the [package for After Effects](https://github.com/seblavoie/After-Effects-Scripting-Sublime-Text-Package) by Seb Lavoie and the completion file from moluapple's [package for Illustrator and Indesign](https://github.com/moluapple/Sublime-Extendscript) (Windows only). It provides code completion in Sublime Text 2 and the ability to run the scripts in Illustrator via the build command.


## Limitations

- The build & run scripts are hard coded for Illustrator CC en_GB version. Editing them for other installations should be trivial enough but there is no handy config file yet.
- Windows script is completely untested
- Be sure to save your script in UTF8 (withough BOM). Extenscript interprets [Byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) as a syntax error.


## Build System

The build system will : 

1. Copy your current .jsx file in your Illustrator Scripts folder so you don't have to develop in that folder.
2. Run the script in Illustrator.

`git clone https://github.com/seblavoie/After-Effects-Scripting-Sublime-Text-Package.git Illustrators`
